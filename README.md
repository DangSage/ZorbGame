# Zorb Game Project - Applying C++ Principles
Compiled using MINGW64 via build tasks (see .vscode/tasks.json)

## Overview
The Zorb Game Project is a personal endeavor aimed at applying fundamental principles of C++ programming to develop a text-based terminal game. This will incorporate key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) including classes, functions, and modular code organization.

## Principles Applied
### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The `Zorb` and `ZorbAppearance` classes encapsulate game object properties and appearance, respectively.
- OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction are applied.

### 2. Modularization
- The project is organized into separate header files, promoting modularity and code reusability.
- Each header file serves a specific purpose, enhancing code maintainability.

### 3. Abstraction
- Header files abstract the implementation details, allowing users to interact with game objects and utilities through well-defined interfaces.

### 4. Code Reusability
- Utility functions in `zUtility.hpp` can be reused across the project, reducing redundancy.

### 5. Operator Overloading
- `Zorb` class overloads operators for custom behaviors, improving code readability.

## Learning and Growth
This project is my attempt at applying C++ principles and techniques learned during my current sophomore fall semester. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce understanding and enhance programming skills.

As the project evolves, the goal is to create an engaging text-based game with a user-friendly interface while adhering to best practices in C++ programming.

Please refer to the source code and header files within the repository for more details.
