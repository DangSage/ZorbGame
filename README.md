# Zorb Game Project - Applying C++ Principles

## Overview
The Zorb Game Project is a personal endeavor aimed at applying fundamental principles of C++ programming to develop a text-based game. As a learning project, it incorporates key concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), classes, functions, and modular code organization.

## Header Files
The project employs the following header files, each contributing to the game's functionality:

- `zUtility.hpp`: Provides utility functions for random number generation, text formatting, and memory management.
- `Zorb.hpp`: Defines the Zorb class, representing game objects with various properties and behaviors.
- `ZorbAppearance.hpp`: Manages the appearance of Zorb game objects, allowing customization.
- `Z_UI.hpp`: Handles the user interface by displaying game information and Zorb objects in an organized manner.

## Principles Applied
### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The `Zorb` and `ZorbAppearance` classes encapsulate game object properties and appearance, respectively.
- OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction are applied.

### 2. Modularization
- The project is organized into separate header files, promoting modularity and code reusability.
- Each header file serves a specific purpose, enhancing code maintainability.

### 3. Abstraction
- Header files abstract the implementation details, allowing users to interact with game objects and utilities through well-defined interfaces.

### 4. Code Reusability
- Utility functions in `zUtility.hpp` can be reused across the project, reducing redundancy.

### 5. Operator Overloading
- `Zorb` class overloads operators for custom behaviors, improving code readability.

## Learning and Growth
This project is my attempt at applying C++ principles and techniques learned during my current sophomore fall semester. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce understanding and enhance programming skills.

As the project evolves, the goal is to create an engaging text-based game with a user-friendly interface while adhering to best practices in C++ programming.

Please refer to the source code and header files within the repository for more details.
